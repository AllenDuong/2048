Inspired by the game that captivated all of us in highschool, we set out to
create 2048 for our fund comp final project.

TODO / BUGS

- [x] TODO: Fix the random square adder function - right now it is not optimized
for end of game cases (the odd of choosing a valid location randomly is very small)
- [x] BUG: If no movement occurs, a random block is still generated
- [x] TODO: Make it only play once per key press
- [x] TODO: Add max score feature
- [ ] BUG: Allow game to continue if player can add squares, even if board is full
