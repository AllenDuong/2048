Allen Duong | Noah Yoshida

Inspired by the game that captivated all of us in highschool, we set out to
create 2048 for our fund comp final project.

TODO / BUGS
---

- [ ] TODO: Fix the random square adder function - right now it is not optimized
for end of game cases (the odd of choosing a valid location randomly is very small)
- [ ] BUG: If no movement occurs, a random block is still generated
- [ ] TODO: Make it only play once per key press

USAGE
