1. Values disappear sometimes, especially when you initially start playing.
2. If you select a move which would cause no movement, then the player has to
choose another move. Not implemented currently.
3. Implement GFX drawing and animation
4. Segfaults (sometimes? lol) when you quit. This might be a problem with my local machine, however, sometimes this happened on HW assignments, but they worked fine on the student machines.
